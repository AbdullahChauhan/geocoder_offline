## Examples

For using the reverse geocoding library you need to provide а file with data about places among you want to run reverse geocoding. 
In examples you can see how to use а library with two example files:
 1. [GeoNames data](http://www.geonames.org) file with all world cities with a population above 15 000
 2. [USGS data](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data) file with USA cities with a population above 5000.

Library allows you to use any other file who has at least data about name, latitude, and longitude of places you want to search.
